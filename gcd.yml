# For each service, you'll need to configure two Kubernetes objectsâ€”a deployment and a service
# 
# Deployments manage sets of pods to keep the "desired state" of the cluster. 
# Pods are collections of containers. Because they are created and destroyed dynamically,
# services are needed to provide fixed addresses by which to access them. Which pods are 
# targeted by which services, is determined by label selectors.
